## Tactical Embedder Architecture Update

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Replace basic LSTM with advanced BiLSTM architecture in models.py
     ☐ Update engine.py for dual outputs (mu and sigma)
     ☐ Add tests for new tactical embedder architecture
     ☐ Update configuration in settings.yaml
     ☐ Add tactical-specific loss function
     ☐ Add monitoring for momentum patterns
     ☐ Create production validation script
     ☐ Create migration script for existing checkpoints
     ☐ Add training configuration for tactical embedder

### Notes
- Prioritize completing the BiLSTM architecture implementation
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new architecture
- Validate performance improvements over previous LSTM model
